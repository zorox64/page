            <p>I've had a passion for mountain biking ever since I was a kid, starting when I was 11 and very quickly taking part in my first competitions, which didn't go so well the first few times. I finished my first 3 competitions disqualified for injury due to falls. <br> After that, I stopped competing for a few years before resuming in 2019.  I was able to make a few podiums, then finally stopped mountain biking to come and work for my studies in Colmar.</p>

            <p>I'm passionate about video games, and it's one of my favorite pastimes. When I have nothing to do, I spend a lot of time there, keeping in touch with my old friends and brothers. I live quite far from my family, and being very close to my brothers, I'm able to keep a certain complicity with games.<br>I listen to a lot of music of all kinds and I often went out with my friends to see concerts all over France.</p>

            <p>I currently play badminton every Sunday as a hobby, which allows me to let off steam and practice a sporting activity. <br> I'm also setting up an out-of-school project with some friends to organize small video game competitions in my region, which allows me to practice being really disorganized.<br> I'm also learning to manage events and find solutions on my own, which I think is a very good thing. <br> I can also let off steam in ways other than sport, while keeping in touch with my friends who are also passionate about this project.</p>
